# Experimental Methods Seminar #

This repository holds materials for a course on experimental design and analysis. The initial version of this course is being taught as a master seminar at Aarhus University during Spring term 2014. This repository contains syllabi for two versions of the course that I'm developing: one focused on experimental design (with more coverage of practical and substantive matters) and one focused on experimental analysis (with more focus on statistics and implementation). The Spring 2014 version of the class focuses on design.

The course website can be found at: http://www.thomasleeper.com/expcourse
