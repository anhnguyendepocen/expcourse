# Experimental Methods Seminar #

This repository holds materials for a course on experimental methods. I'm teaching an initial version of this course as a master seminar at Aarhus University during Spring term 2014. This repository contains syllabi for two versions of the course that I'm developing: one focused on experimental design (with more coverage of practical and substantive matters) and one focused on experimental analysis (with more focus on statistics and implementation).

## Syllabus ##

For the Design course, you can find an outline of the course objectives, schedule for the course, and assigned readings in the [Syllabus](/Syllabus-Design.pdf).

Those who are interested can also glance at the [Analysis Syllabus](/Syllabus-Analysis.pdf), which is still in draft form.


## Slides ##

PDF versions of course slides (and the LaTeX sources for those slides) are available in the [/Slides](/Slides) directory.


## Motivation for Using GitHub ##

The motivation behind building a syllabus and materials on GitHub is free dissemination of course materials for the benefit of other instructors and students. With this in mind, this repository is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). Materials from this repository can be forked, copied, reused, and modified in any way at any time for any purpose, provided attribution back to the original author is included *and* any derivative works are released under a similar license (i.e., don't pass any of this off as your own work and don't place additional copyright restrictions on the use of any derivative works).

My plan is to create branches for each iteration of the course and merge the most recent version back into the master branch, preserving each version of the course separately for posterity.

The Chronicle of Higher Education's [ProfHacker blog](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/tag/github) has discussed the potential for GitHub for this kind of course. Their posts might be helpful to anyone who is interested in this kind of course sharing but who is unfamiliar with git and GitHub.
