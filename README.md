# Experimental Methods Seminar #

This repository holds materials for a course on experimental design and analysis. The initial version of this course is being taught as a master seminar at Aarhus University during Spring term 2014. This repository contains syllabi for two versions of the course that I'm developing: one focused on experimental design (with more coverage of practical and substantive matters) and one focused on experimental analysis (with more focus on statistics and implementation). The Spring 2014 version of the class focuses on design.

## Syllabus ##

For the design course, you can find an outline of the course objectives, schedule for the course, and assigned readings in the [Syllabus](/Syllabus-Design.pdf).

Those who are interested can also glance at the [Analysis Syllabus](/Syllabus-Analysis.pdf), which is still in draft form. Though the Spring 2014 course will use the design syllabus, those interested in more advanced issues in experimental data analysis might find this syllabus helpful.


## Readings ##

In addition to journal articles on the syllabus, the course will use the following two books:

William R. Shadish, Thomas D. Cook, and Donald T. Campbell. *Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Generalized Causal Inference.* Houghton-Mifflin, Boston, MA, 2001.

Alan S. Gerber and Donald P. Green. *Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation.* W.W. Norton, 2012.

Shadish et al. provide a useful conceptual background for the practice of causally oriented social research. Gerber and Green supplement this text with an explicit focus on experimental design and analysis in the modern language of the Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework.


## Slides ##

PDF versions of course slides (and the LaTeX sources for those slides) are available in the [/Slides](/Slides) directory.
