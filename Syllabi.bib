	this largely pedagogical function and delineate the conceptual and

	of effects identified as "social" required a radical break with traditional

	to the investigation of effects that were proximal, local, short-term,
	and decomposable. A viable accommodation to these constraints occurred
	in the closely related programs of Moede's experimental crowd psychology
	and Floyd Allport's experimental social psychology. Later, Kurt Lewin
	attempted to provide a different conceptual foundation for the field
	by drawing on certain precepts of Gestalt psychology and the philosophy
	of scientific experimentation developed by Ernst Cassirer. These
	ideas were poorly understood and were soon replaced by a methodological
	regime in which a new generation of statistical procedures and experimental
	design shaped implicit conceptions of the social in social psychological
	experiments through such procedures as randomization and the additive

	frequently cite Stanley Milgram's 'obedience experiments' as evidence.
	These critics say that arguments for justification tend to downplay
	the risks involved and overstate the benefits from such research.
	Milgram, they add, committed both sins. Critics are right to point
	out that research oversight is often susceptible to self-serving
	abuse. But stating a priori how beneficial a given experiment will
	be is a tall order for psychologists, or anyone else. At the same
	time, critics themselves have difficulty in showing what is wrong
	with deception, and how subjects in these experiments suffer. Hence,
	it becomes unclear what the psychologists, including Milgram, are
	prone to downplay. There is also room to wonder how the Milgram studies
	can illuminate the debate over deception. Although Milgram probably
	exaggerated the scientific significance of his own work, critics
	who exaggerate its moral and historical significance do little to
	clarify the status of deception.},

	on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same

	among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this
	framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the
	studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller;
	when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested
	relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions,
	outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and
	other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in
	a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations
	show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely
	for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current
	scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply
	accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss
	the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation

  pages = {172},
  address = {Cambridge, MA},
  abstract = {This book provides a language and a set of tools for finding bounds
	on the predictions that social and behavioral scientists can logically
	make from nonexperimental and experimental data. The economist Charles
	Manski draws on examples from criminology, demography, epidemiology,
	social psychology, and sociology as well as economics to illustrate
	this language and to demonstrate the broad usefulness of the tools.There
	are many traditional ways to present identification problems in econometrics,
	sociology, and psychometrics. Some of these are primarily statistical
	in nature, using concepts such as flat likelihood functions and nondistinct
	parameter estimates. Manski's strategy is to divorce identification
	from purely statistical concepts and to present the logic of identification
	analysis in ways that are accessible to a wide audience in the social
	and behavioral sciences. In each case, problems are motivated by
	real examples with real policy importance, the mathematics is kept
	to a minimum, and the deductions on identifiability are derived giving
	fresh insights.Manski begins with the conceptual problem of extrapolating
	predictions from one population to some new population or to the
	future. He then analyzes in depth the fundamental selection problem
	that arises whenever a scientist tries to predict the effects of
	treatments on outcomes. He carefully specifies assumptions and develops
	his nonparametric methods of bounding predictions. Manski shows how
	these tools should be used to investigate common problems such as
	predicting the effect of family structure on children's outcomes
	and the effect of policing on crime rates.Successive chapters deal
	with topics ranging from the use of experiments to evaluate social
	programs, to the use of case-control sampling by epidemiologists
	studying the association of risk factors and disease, to the use
	of intentions data by demographers seeking to predict future fertility.
	The book closes by examining two central identification problems
	in the analysis of social interactions: the classical simultaneity
	problem of econometrics and the reflection problem faced in analyses
	of neighborhood and contextual effects.},

	for eliminating selection bias in observational studies. To meet
	this assumption, researchers often rely on a strategy of selecting
	covariates that they think will control for selection bias. Theory
	indicates that the most important covariates are those highly correlated
	with both the real selection process and the potential outcomes.
	However, when planning a study, it is rarely possible to identify
	such covariates with certainty. In this article, we report on an
	extensive reanalysis of a within-study comparison that contrasts
	a randomized experiment and a quasi-experiment. Various covariate
	sets were used to adjust for initial group differences in the quasi-experiment
	that was characterized by self-selection into treatment. The adjusted
	effect sizes were then compared with the experimental ones to identify
	which individual covariates, and which conceptually grouped sets
	of covariates, were responsible for the high degree of bias reduction
	achieved in the adjusted quasi-experiment. Such results provide strong
	clues about preferred strategies for identifying the covariates most
	likely to reduce bias when planning a study and when the true selection
	process is not known.},
