name: Types 

# Types of Experiments #

 - Lab: treat in a controlled research environment

 - Field: treatment occurs in course of everyday life

 - Survey: treatment occurs outside of the control of the research

#### Agreement

.right-column[
> If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon.

.right-column[
> If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or an necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon.

> If two or more instances in which the phenomenon occurs have only one circumstance in common, while two or more instances in which it does not occur have nothing in common save the absence of that circumstance; the circumstance in which alone the two sets of instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or a necessary part of the cause, of the phenomenon.

name: principles of causality
# Four (or five) principles of causality #

 - Relationship

 - Direction (temporality)

 - Nonconfounding

 - Mechanism

 - Appropriate level of analysis
---
# Causal inference #

 - Traditional observational research approach

 - "The observation of one or more units."
---
# Definition of an experiment #

 - Minimum definition
 > The observation of one or more units after an intervention in a controlled setting.

 - More complete definition
 > The observation of units after, and possibly before, a randomly assigned intervention in a controlled setting, which tests one or more precise causal expectations.

---
# Definition of an experiment #

 - Physical intervention

 - Control

 - Treatment assignment independent of potential outcomes

 - That being in one condition or the other is uncorrelated with the values of the dependent variable

 - Being in one condition or another is also uncorrelated with any other independent variable that is related to the dependent variable

 - Differences between this and quasi-experiments
---
# Fundamental problem of causal inference #

---
# Scientific solution #

 - Physical sciences (e.g., agriculture)

 - Take the same unit and it expose it to both treatments at different points in time

 - Take two similar units and expose to the two treatments at the same

 - Requires constant effect assumption: that the past does not matter and that differences between units do not matter

 - Also requires homogeneity of units assumption

---
# Statistical solution #

 - Random assignment

 - Neyman

---
# Terminology #

 - Unit: A physical object at a particular point in time

 - Treatment: An intervention, whose effects we wish to assess relative to some other (non-)intervention

 - Potential outcomes: The outcome for each unit that we would observe if that unit received each treatment

 - Multiple potential outcomes for each unit, but we only observe one of them

 - Causal effect: The comparisons between the unit-level potential outcomes under each intervention

 - Average causal effect

# "Perfect Doctor" #

True potential outcomes (unobservable in reality)

| Unit | Y(0) | Y(1) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1 | 13 | 14 |
| 2 | 6 | 0 |
| 3 | 4 | 1 |
| 4 | 5 | 2 |
| 5 | 6 | 3 |
| 6 | 6 | 1 |
| 7 | 8 | 10 |
| 8 | 8 | 9 |
| Mean | 7 | 5 |
