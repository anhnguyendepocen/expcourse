# External Validity #
## April 8 ##


---
## Definition

How do we define external validity?

  - Mundane realism (surface similarity)
  
  - Generalizability of results

  
???

SSC p.353 and Table 11.1 (p.357), Five principles:

 - Surface similarity
 
 - Ruling out irrelevancies
 
   - Units differ in many ways but those differences may not be important
 
 - Making discriminations
 
 - Interpolation and extrapolation
 
 - Causal explanation
  
---
## Discussion

Why do we care about external validity?


???


---
## SUTO framework

  - Setting

  - Units

  - Treatments

  - Outcome


???

 - SUTO is about surface similarity but it is also about formal generalizability; if surface similarities are what differentiate among effects, then SUTO is informative about formal generalizability

 - Setting
 
   - Lab
   - Field
   - Survey
   
   - Broader contextual variations (Rune will talk about this next week)
   
   - When in the life histories of units does the experiment occur (pretreatment paper we read a few weeks ago)
 
 - Units
 
   - Sampling techniques
   
   - Who are they? Are they representative of the population we care about? In what ways?
   
   - Not just demographic similarity, but also life histories:
     - E.g., studying the effect of university education on students in their 20s does not necessarily lead to valid inferences about students in university in their 30s
 
 - Treatments
 
   - Does this treatment look like the treatment units would actually receive in the real world?
   
   - Is the treatment/experiment too obtrusive to be generalizable?
 
 - Outcome

   - Construct: is this experiment about the same construct as we care about in the real world
   
   - Operationalization: is this experiment using the same operationalization as the treatment in the real world

## Assessing external validity

The most common method of assessing external validity is the *review*
  
  1. Qualitative reviews
  
  2. Quantitative/systematic reviews (meta-analysis)
  
???

 - Qualitative reviews
 
   - Strengths?
   
     - Focus on variations and SUTO
     - Focus on mundane realism
     
   - Weaknesses?
   
     - File drawer problem
     - Hard to get measures of effect sizes
     - Do not account for size of studies

 - Quantitative reviews
  
   - Strengths?
   
     - Precise measures of effect sizes
     
   
   - Weaknesses?
   
     - File drawer problem
     - Focus primarily on effect size rather than qualitative variations
     - Often not a lot of consideration of broader context
     - May be difficult to do because of lack of information in published studies

## Assessing external validity

Other strategies of assessing external validity include:

  - Formal/exact replication
  
  - Approximate replication
  
  - Statistical generalization
  
  - Parallel experimentation

???

  - Formal replication requires detailed protocol
  
  - Approximate replication is what Ansolabehere et al. do
  
  - Statistical generalization is what Hedges is talking about
  
  - Parallel experimentation is complex
  
    - Many labs project
    
    - My parallel experiment project

---
## Exact replication

 - Recreate a previous experiment exactly
 
 - Requires a complete protocol

 - SUTO: What can we replicate?
 
???
 
 - SUTO
 
   - Same setting possible, but different broader context
   
   - Units might be similar, but different individuals; might be difficult to recruit from same population
   
   - Treatments should be identical; this is easy with proper protocol
   
   - Outcomes should be identical; this is easy with proper protocol
 

---
## Approximate replication

 - Model a new study off a previous study
 
 - Possibly intentional changes in SUTO characteristics
 
???
 
 - SUTO
 
   - Same setting possible, but different broader context; this may be intentionally varied
     - Lab/field comparisons common
     - We might test something again in a different historical context (does political deliberation have the same effects today as it did in the past?)
   
   - Units might be similar, but different individuals; might be difficult to recruit from same population
     - Convenience sample versus population sample
   
   - Treatments can be identical; this is easy with proper protocol
     - But we might intentionally change this (e.g., using a different kind of negative ad)
   
   - Outcomes can be identical; this is easy with proper protocol
     - But we might intentionally change this (e.g., measuring actual turnout as opposed to self-reported turnout intentions)

---
## Statistical Generalization

 - Hedges is interested in the formal, statistical generalization of experiments
 
 - How does this work?
 
???

Propensity score subclassification approach

TATE is a re-weighted function of conditional ATEs in our experimental sample


---
## Parallel Experiments

 - Execute the same experiment with variations in some experimental feature
 
 - Compare results across experiments
 
 - SUTO: What can we replicate?
  
???

 - Expensive
 
 - Difficult
 
 - SUTO
 
   - Might vary geographical setting (usually trying to hold this context); Might implement the study at different points in time controlling all else (Rune and I are doing this now)
   
   - Might vary units intentionally
   
   - Might vary treatment, controlling all else (real ads versus fabricated ads)
   
   - Might vary outcomes, controlling all else


---
## Discussion

How important is it for an experiment to have high external validity?

--

What is the point of a single experiment if it does not generalize?

???

 - What does it mean to generalize?
 
   - Theory is wrong in first place
   - Theory is context-dependent
   - Original study or replication are flawed in some way
 
 - To what should we expect a given study to generalize?
