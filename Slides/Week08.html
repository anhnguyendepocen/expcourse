# External Validity #
## April 8 ##


---
## Definition

How do we define external validity?

  - Mundane realism (surface similarity)
  
  - Generalizability of results

  
???

SSC p.353 and Table 11.1 (p.357), Five principles:

 - Surface similarity
 
 - Ruling out irrelevancies
 
   - Units differ in many ways but those differences may not be important
 
 - Making discriminations
 
 - Interpolation and extrapolation
 
 - Causal explanation
  
---
## SUTO framework

  - Setting

  - Units

  - Treatments

  - Outcome


???

 - Setting
 
   - Lab
   - Field
   - Survey
 
 - Units
 
   - Sampling techniques
 
 - Treatments
 
   
 
 - Outcome

   - Construct
   - Operationalization

## Threats to external validity
   
  - SUTO + context-dependent mediation

.footnote[SSC Table 3.2, p.87]

---
## Assessing external validity

  - The most common method of assessing external validity is the *review*
  
  - Qualitative reviews
  
  - Quantitative/systematic reviews (meta-analysis)
  
???

 - Qualitative reviews
 
   - Strengths?
     - Focus on variations and SUTO
     -
   - Weaknesses?
     - File drawer problem
     - Hard to get measures of effect sizes
     - Do not account for size of studies

  - Quantitative reviews
  
   - Strengths?
   - Weaknesses?
     - File drawer problem

## Assessing external validity

Other strategies of assessing external validity include:

  - Formal/exact replication
  
  - Approximate replication
  
  - Parallel experimentation

???

  - Formal replication requires detailed protocol
  
  - Approximate replication is what Ansolabehere et al. do
  
  - Parallel experimentation is complex
  
    - Many labs project
    
    - My parallel experiment project

## Discussion

How important is it for an experiment to have high external validity?

--

What is the point of a single experiment if it does not generalize?

???

 - What does it mean to generalize?
 
   - Theory is wrong in first place
   - Theory is context-dependent
   - Original study or replication are flawed in some way
 
 - To what should we expect a given study to generalize?
