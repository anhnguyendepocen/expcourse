# Internal Validity and Expermental Design #
## February 18 ##

---
## Outline

 1. Share examples from TESS
 
 2. Talk about how to write experimental designs
 
 3. Internal validity
   - Why randomization works
   - Threats to internal validity


---
## Examples from TESS

 - What was the most interesting study you found on TESS?
 
 - What was the topic (outcome conept and research question)?
 
 - What was the design?

---
## Protocol
 
 - Writing up experimental designs

---
## Experimental designs
  - SSC Ch.8
  - Post-test only versus pre-post designs
    - History, maturation
    - Precision in standard errors
  - Control groups and placebo groups
  - Cross-over designs
  - More conditions
    - Single-factor designs
    - Factorial designs
      - Full versus partial factorial
      - Control groups
      - Advantages
      - Sample size considerations
      - Interaction effects


---
## Internal validity
  - Threats to internal validity (SSC Table 2.4, p.55)
    - Ambiguous temporal precedence
    - Selection
    - History
    - Maturation
    - Regression
    - Attrition
    - Testing (exposure to test affects subsequent scores; measurement has an effect)
    - Instrumentation (changing measurement over time)
--
## Which of these threats is solved by randomized experimentation?
    - All but attrition, testing, and instrumentation
    - Assuming well-designed protocol, then we just have to deal with testing and attrition

---
## Ethics of randomization

  - Equipoise
  
  - Treatment preferences


---
    
- Statistical conclusion validity
  - Threats to statistical conclusion validity (SSC Table 2.2, p.45)
  - Power (more on this next week)

- Measurement and operationalization
  - Content validity: does it include everything it is supposed to measure
  - Construct validity: does the instrument actually measure the particular dimension of interest 
  - Predictive validity: does it predict what it is supposed to
  - Face validity: does it make sense

- Pretesting of treatments and outcome measures

---
## Next week

 - Continue our discussion of designs
 
 - Talk about experimental analysis
 
 - No example study for next week (because there is a lot to cover)
 
 - Do not read the Splawa-Neyman text
   - It's just there in case you're really interested in the statistics of experiments
