# Internal Validity and Experimental Design #
## February 18 ##

---
## Outline

 1. Share examples from TESS
 
 2. Talk about how to write experimental designs
 
 3. Internal validity
   - Why randomization works
   - Threats to internal validity


---
## Examples from TESS

 - What was the most interesting study you found on TESS?
 
 - What was the topic (outcome concept and research question)?
 
 - What was the design?

---
name: protocol

## Protocol
 
 - Writing up experimental designs
 
 - Once we know our hypotheses, the experimental conditions are easy
 
---
## Examples

What experimental conditions do we need?

 1. Individuals exposed to expert endorsements are more likely to support a policy than when exposed to partisan endorsements.

 2. Providing conditional cash transfers to women in rural Uganda is more effective at increasing their childrens' educational attainment than either microfinance loans to start businesses or unconditional grants of cash or goods (e.g., food).

 3. The effect of a public health intervention is more effective for native speakers of Danish than non-native speakers of Danish.

template: protocol

 - But, there are still lots of decisions to make!

---
## Experimental designs
  - SSC Ch.8
  - Post-test only versus pre-post designs
    - History, maturation
    - Precision in standard errors
  - Control groups and placebo groups
  - Cross-over designs
  - More conditions
    - Single-factor designs
    - Factorial designs
      - Full versus partial factorial
      - Control groups
      - Advantages
      - Sample size considerations
      - Interaction effects


---
## Threats to validity

 - "Falsificationist" strategy *
 
 - No experiment is perfect
 
.footnote[* SCC pp.41-42]

???

Simply because we have avoided or dealt with known threats, doesn't mean we have a valid inference

---
## Internal validity
  - Threats to internal validity (SSC Table 2.4, p.55)
    - Ambiguous temporal precedence
    - Selection
    - History
    - Maturation
    - Regression
    - Attrition
    - Testing (exposure to test affects subsequent scores; measurement has an effect)
    - Instrumentation (changing measurement over time)

--
## Internal validity in experiments

Which of these threats is solved by randomized experimentation?

 - All but attrition, testing, and instrumentation

 - Assuming well-designed protocol, then we just have to deal with testing and attrition

---
## Ethics of randomization

  - Equipoise
  
  - Treatment preferences


---
## Threats to statistical conclusion validity
 
  1. Power
  2. Statistical assumption violations
  3. Fishing
  4. Measurement error
  5. Restriction of range
  6. Protocol violations
  7. Loss of control
  8. Unit heterogeneity (on DV)
  9. Statistical artefacts

.footnote[SSC Table 2.2 (p.45)]

---
## Measurement and operationalization
  - Content validity: does it include everything it is supposed to measure
  - Construct validity: does the instrument actually measure the particular dimension of interest 
  - Predictive validity: does it predict what it is supposed to
  - Face validity: does it make sense

 - Pretesting of treatments and outcome measures

---
## Next week

 - Continue our discussion of designs
 
 - Talk about experimental analysis
 
 - No example study for next week (because there is a lot to cover in class)
 
 - Do not read the Splawa-Neyman text
   - It's just there in case you're really interested in the statistics of experiments
