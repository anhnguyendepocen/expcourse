## Review
 
 1. Fundamental problem of causal inference
 
???

Why do we do experiments?

How do they help us?


--
 2. Validity
 
???

Construct validity

Internal validity

External validity

Statistical conclusion validity

--
 3. Experimental Design
 
 
???

Experiments are complicated and involve many choices. All of those choices have to follow from a causal question and hypothesis.

## Exam

 1. Cover everything in the protocol

???

 1. What is the research question? What constructs are be used?
 
 2. What is the theoretical perspective? What are the precisely stated hypotheses? (Hypotheses must be testable and falsifiable via a comparison of two or more treatment groups.)
 
 3. What variables are used? Manipulated? Measured? Outcomes? Are they valid operationalizations?
 
 4. What is the experimental design? What conditions are involved? How are the hypothesized factors manipulated?
 
 5. When, where, and how are data collected? Lab, field, or survey? How are units recruited and assigned? What costs are involved? Are there ethical concerns, compliance or attrition issues, or other practical considerations? What challenges do you anticipate in the implementation?
 
 6. How will the experiment be analyzed and what will you do with the results?

 2. Design and justify a budget

???
 
 1. What is your ideal experiment? How much does it cost? How many units are in the study? What is its statistical power? If you had less money, what would the design look like?
 
--
 3. Focus on anticipating challenges and your strategies for addressing them

???

 1. You both want to address challenges before they happen and have strategies (practical or statistical for addressing them). How will you reallocate resources to address compliance or attrition? Will you use intention-to-treat, as-treated, or some other kind of analysis?
