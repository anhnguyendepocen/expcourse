---
## Uses of survey experiments

 - Substantive experiments
 
 - Procedural experiments
 
---
## Substantive experiments

 - Only work well when units are individuals
 
 - "Lab in field"
 
 - Focus on sample representativeness


---
## Readings

 - Druckman et al.
 
 - Hainmueller and Hiscox

---
## Procedural experiments

 - How do we best measure some construct?
 
 - How do we recruit participants?
 
 - How do we prevent nonresponse or break-off?
 
 - How do we test respondent engagement?

---
## Procedural experiments

 - Question wording and ordering
 
 - Labelling and number of response scales
 
 - List experiment

 - Etc.

---
## Readings

 - Holbrook and Krosnick

---
## Protocol Considerations

  - Survey mode

  - Sampling

  - Control
  
  - Questionnaire Design


---
## Survey mode

 - Face-to-face
 
 - Computer Assisted Self-Interviewing
 
 - Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing
 
 - Paper-and-pencil Self-Interviewing
 
 - Web-based (or mobile) Self-Interviewing

???

Interviewers? Costs? Training? Impact on measurement?

Does mode affect responses?

Can/should you implement multiple modes?

---
## Sampling

 - What is your target population?

 - How do you sample and contact them?

 - Do you need a representative sample?
 
???

Nonresponse affects representativeness

Can you use a panel? What effect does that have?

---
## Control

 - Surveys are less controlled than lab
 
   - Setting
   - Broader context
   - Engagement
 
 - Surveys may be more private than lab
 
 

---
## Questionnaire Design



---
## Synopsis Presentations

 - Everyone present for 1-2 minutes
 
 - Discuss
